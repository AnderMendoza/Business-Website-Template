Hello, I would like to start by clarifying that this project is open source so you can use it without problems. The only thing I ask is that if you use this project and find it useful, leave me a star in this repository.

Now about this project, basically I wanted to share with the community a design and development option that serves as a guide or even is used as is for those moments in which we look for inspiration before developing.

<!-- DESIGN -->

## Design

I invite you to take a look at the design progress in Figma of the website!
I have put all my effort and enthusiasm into creating a visually attractive and functional experience for the template.
This is the final model of the web page design.
